# 1)additive Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This Python script implements the Caesar cipher encryption technique. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# Usage:
=>Clone the repository or download the additive.cipher.encrypt.py or additive.cipher.decrypt.py file.
=>Run the script using Python. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
=>Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted.
=>Enter the shift value, which indicates the number of positions each letter in the plaintext/ciphertext should be shifted.
=>The script will output the encrypted/decrypted text.

# Note
=>The script preserves the case of letters (uppercase or lowercase) in the original text.
=>Non-alphabetic characters (such as numbers, punctuation, and spaces) remain unchanged.


# 2)Affine Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script implements the Affine cipher encryption and decryption techniques. The Affine cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a mathematical function, and then converted back to a letter.

# Features
=>Encryption: Convert plaintext to ciphertext using the specified keys.
=>Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext using the inverse keys.

# Notes
=>The keys k1 and k2 must satisfy certain conditions for the encryption and decryption processes to work correctly.
=>Ensure that the plaintext contains only alphabetical characters (A-Z, a-z) and no special characters or numbers.


# 3)Multiplicative Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script implements the Multiplicative cipher encryption and decryption techniques. The Multiplicative cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is multiplied by a key, modulo the alphabet size, to generate the ciphertext.

# Features
=>Encryption: Convert plaintext to ciphertext using the specified key.
=>Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext using the inverse key.

# Notes
=>The key must be chosen such that it has a modular multiplicative inverse in the alphabet size (26).
=>Ensure that the plaintext contains only alphabetical characters (A-Z, a-z) and no special characters or numbers.

# 4)Playfair Cipher Encryption

This Python script implements the Playfair cipher encryption technique. The Playfair cipher is a substitution cipher that uses a 5x5 grid of letters to encrypt pairs of letters in the plaintext.

# Features
Encryption: Encrypts plaintext using the Playfair cipher algorithm.
Key Square: Generates the key square based on the given keyword.
Text Preparation: Prepares the plaintext and the key for encryption.

# Notes
=>The key should contain only alphabetical characters (A-Z) and no special characters or numbers.
=>The plaintext can contain any characters, but they will be converted to uppercase.
=>The script automatically handles the replacement of "J" with "I" in the plaintext and the key.

# 5)Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script implements the Vigenère cipher encryption and decryption technique. The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages.

# Features
=>Encryption: Encrypts plaintext using the Vigenère cipher algorithm.
=>Decryption: Decrypts ciphertext using the Vigenère cipher algorithm.
=>Key Handling: Handles the keyword for encryption and decryption.
=>Alphabet Handling: Supports uppercase and lowercase alphabets

# Notes
=>The keyword should contain only alphabetical characters (A-Z, a-z) and no special characters or numbers.
=>Both the plaintext and the ciphertext can contain any characters, but they will be converted to uppercase.
=>The script automatically handles the wrapping of the keyword for encryption and decryption.
